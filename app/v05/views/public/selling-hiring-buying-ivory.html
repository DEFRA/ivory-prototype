    <p class="govuk-body">You must <a href="start">register or apply for a certificate</a> to:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>sell or hire an ivory item</li>
        <li>offer to sell or hire an ivory item</li>
        <li>exchange an ivory item for another good or service</li>
        <li>keep an ivory item for sale or hire</li>
        <li>export or import an ivory item for sale or hire</li>
      </ul>

    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-7">You do not need to register or apply for a certificate if you:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>own an ivory item you do not plan to sell or hire</li>
        <li>give or donate an ivory item</li>
        <li>inherit an ivory item</li>
      </ul>

    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-7">If you’re not sure your item has ivory in it, you can ask a professional to assess it for you.</p>


    <h2 id="how-to" class="govuk-heading-l">How to register or apply for a certificate</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">It's easier to <a href="start">do it online</a>. You can also <a href="#">use a paper form</a></p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You do not have to register and apply for a certificate for the same item. An item would either need registration or a certificate.</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Online</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before starting the online process, you'll need:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a photo of the item</li>
      <li>a debit or credit card</li>
    </uL>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Paper</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Here's how to do it on paper.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">After registering</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">When you’ve completed the registration and paid the fee, you’ll get:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>an email to say that you've completed your registration</li>
      <li>a payment reference number (this is not your registration number)</li>
      <li>your registration document within 2 working days of completing the registration</li>
    </uL>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">After applying for a certificate</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">When you’ve completed the application and paid the fee:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your application will go to one of our selected assessors</li>
        <li>the assessor will use the information you’ve provided to assess the item, giving their opinion and reasons</li>
        <li>APHA (Animal and Plant Health Agency) will decide whether to grant a certificate</li>
        <li>if your application is successful, we'll email you a certificate</li>
        <li>if your application is refused, we'll let you know why</li>
      </ul>

    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body">It should take no more than 30 days to get a decision about certificates, although in some cases this may be longer.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you disagree with a decision that has been made, you have the right to appeal that decision.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">An item’s certificate has no expiry date. If you sell an item with a certificate, you can transfer the certificate to the new owner.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can request a replacement certificate if you cannot find the original certificate.</p>



    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Fees</h3>


    <p class="govuk-body">It costs £# to register and £## to apply for a certificate.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You will not get a refund if your registration is withdrawn or application is refused.</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Acting for someone else</h3>


    <p class="govuk-body">You can register or apply for a certificate on behalf of someone else - for example if you’re an auction house.</p>






    <h2 id="register" class="govuk-heading-l">Items you can register</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can register an ivory item if:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>it was made before 1947 with less than 10% ivory</li>
      <li>it's a musical instrument made before 1975 with less than 20% ivory</li>
      <li>it's a portrait miniature made before 1918</li>
      <li>you’ll sell or hire to an approved museum</li>
    </ul>

    </p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Items made before 1947 with less than 10% ivory</h3>


    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Items made before 1947</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">To register, you’ll need to explain why you believe the item was made before 1947.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This may include:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>an original receipt or bill</li>
      <li>an article published before 3 March 1947 with photos or detailed description of the item</li>
      <li>a date mark on the item</li>
      <li>you’ll sell or hire to an approved museum</li>
      <li>a written statement from previous owners, for example if the item is a family heirloom</li>
      <li>a written verification from an expert, such as an antiques specialist or a museum curator</li>
      <li>evidence from a carbon dating test</li>
    </ul>

    </p>


    <p class="govuk-body">If any ivory has been added to the item since 2 March 1947, this ivory must have been:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>added for restoration only</li>
        <li>taken from its elephant source before 1 January 1975</li>
      </ul>

    </p>





    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Items with less than 10% ivory</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll also need to declare that the item made before 1947 has less than 10% ivory by volume.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Items with very small amount of ivory are usually made of other materials such as wood, metal or china.</p>




    <!-- <h5 class="govuk-heading-s">Items likely to have less than 10% ivory</h5>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    </ul> -->



    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Musical instruments made before 1975 with less than 20% ivory</h3>





    <p class="govuk-body">To register, you’ll need to show that:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it’s a musical instrument or an accessory used to play a musical instrument, such as a bow</li>
        <li>it was made before 1975</li>
        <li>it has less than 20% ivory</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The item must have been made for the primary purpose of being played. You can’t register the item under this category if:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it’s in the shape of a musical instrument but not designed to be played</li>
        <li>it could be used to create music or rhythm but was not intended to be used in that way</li>
      </ul>

    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You cannot register individual piano keys.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to register an instrument to:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>play it to an audience, even if you’ll be paid</li>
        <li>teach lessons</li>
        <li>transport it abroad for personal use, professional performance or repair</li>
      <ul>
