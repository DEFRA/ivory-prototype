<p>According to the <a href="">Ivory Act 2018</a> it is legal to own something made of ivory, but it is illegal to sell or hire it.</p>
<p>If you have an item of ivory which meets one of the exemptions to the trading ban</a>, you must declare it first.</p>

    <p>To declare an item before selling or hiring you will need:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <!-- <li>to know which exemption you're applying for</li> -->
      <li>a photograph of your item</li>
      <li>a debit or credit card</li>
    </uL>

    <a href="start-prototype_1" role="button" class="govuk-button govuk-button--start govuk-!-margin-top-2 govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">
          Start now
    </a>
